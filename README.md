# Phone Shop App

* ### This phone shop app got a mock api which generate random numbers for its own use.

## Remember:
* ### the api doesn't respond for build purpouses, just for the dev mode.


## How to run dev mode

* $ npm install

<!-- #### When you need to call someoneâ€™s phone dialling from the internet, you need to use a very common tool in internet communications called soft phone, its basically an internet version of an actual cellphone with its dedicated number. In this test you should make a soft phone phone number store, where the user can buy a phone number to use with his soft phone, also the user will have the ability to select multiple numbers and put it in a shopping cart (and then confirm the purchase, as you will not use a database for this test, when someone confirms the purchase you just need to clean the cart and show a confirmation to the user (a toaster maybe) 


## Milestones:

* Create the numbers shop view with mock data (at least 15 mock numbers)
* Create the cart view (cycle through pages using react-router)
* Store the numbers selected from user on the cart (using redux and local storage)
* Confirm the purchase and show a confirmation to the user -->
